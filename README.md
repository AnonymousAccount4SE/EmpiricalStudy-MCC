# Reproduction Procedure

## Run LIU's [<sup>1</sup>](#liu)

To reproduce the performance of LIU's, one can find the source code and detailed procedures in https://github.com/SerVal-DTF/debug-method-name.

## Run MNIRE [<sup>2</sup>](#mnire)

### Requirements

> **Hardware:** 

> OS: Ubuntu 18.04.1; CPU: 32 * Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz; GPU: 4* TITAN RTX; RAM: 128GB   

> **Software:**
> Python-3.7.9;
> Tensorflow-2.2.0;
> And other requirements listed in ICSE2020/conda_environment_list.txt

### Procedures  
   1. Prepare the environment: 
   
   > conda install --yes --file ICSE2020/conda_environment_list.txt 

   2. Configure Jupyter notebook in your environment.
   
   3. Train and tune the model by running 

   > nnictl create --config ICSE2020/Tuning/config.yml
   
   4. Predict method names by running ICSE2020/predict.ipynb using the model generated from step 3.
   
   5. Get the final identification results 
   
   > java -cp "target/dependency/*" -Xmx8g edu.lu.uni.serval.renamed.methods.ICSE2020_evaluate
   

## BenMark Construction

### Data Collection
   Collect the repositories listed in the Data/TestingRepos.txt, and put them in Data/TestingRepos

   > e.g., git clone https://github.com/apache/odftoolkit.git
   
### Identifying Inconsistent Method Names
   
   1. Configure the testing repository path (e.g., Data/TestingRepos) and output path.
   2. Mining the commit history of each project and find all the renaming operations. Only keep the renaming in a commit where 
      * The method body keep untouched.
      * Both the method name and body keep untouched until the latest commit ever since the renaming.
   > cd debug-method-name/RenamedMethodsCollector
   
   
   > java -cp "target/dependency/*" -Xmx8g edu.lu.uni.serval.renamed.methods.Main

### Identifying Consistent Method Names

   1. Roll each project to **n** commits ago (**n** is the largest duration between the creation time of a method and its first rename in each specific project.)
   
   > cd MCC
   
   > java -cp "target/dependency/*" -Xmx8g edu.lu.uni.serval.renamed.methods.ResetGitRepos

   2. Configure the data path and extract all the methods in this snapshot commit.
   
   > cd debug-method-name/DebugMethodName
   
   > java -cp "target/dependency/*" -Xmx8g edu.lu.uni.serval.MainParser

   3. Only keep the methods which are untouched until the latest commit.

   > cd MCC
   
   > java -cp "target/dependency/*" -Xmx8g edu.lu.uni.serval.renamed.methods.DataPreparer4Con
